<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  This is Disha A, a freshman at NITK while i'm creating this project.
  I am an Information Technology student with passion for web development and technology.
  As a result I have enrolled for the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript">UDEMY FULL STACK COURSE</a> 
  I am currently working on a project to create a portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  I am excited to learn more about web development and improve my skills.
</p>

<p>
  I am a quick learner and enjoy taking on new challenges. I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge
  and skills in web development. I am also interested in exploring other areas of technology, such as data science and
  machine learning.
  I believe that technology has the power to change the world, and I want to be a part of that change.

<p>
  In my free time, I like reading about various mytological aspects and personality development books.
  I also like talking to new people and gain new perspectives about various topics in life.
  I am always looking for opportunities to learn and grow, both personally and professionally.
  I am vey excited not only in the projects or academics but also in the extracurricular activities.
  I am a member of the National Cadet Corps (NCC) and the SMILE club at NITK, both of which show my interest in social service as well as spiritual well being.
